# cub3D

`cub3D` is a 3D graphical project inspired by the classic **Wolfenstein 3D**, built entirely in C using the **MiniLibX** graphics library.  
It is part of the 42 School curriculum and showcases **raycasting**, **2D/3D rendering**, and real-time player interaction.

---

## Project Objective

- Create a simple **3D first-person view** using a 2D map
- Implement a **raycasting engine** (Ã  la Wolfenstein)
- Parse a custom `.cub` map file to generate the world
- Allow movement and rotation in real-time
- Handle wall textures, floor/ceiling coloring, and a basic minimap

---

## Key Concepts

- Raycasting algorithm (DDA)
- Vector math & trigonometry
- Key event handling
- Real-time rendering loop
- Map parsing and validation
- Basic game engine structure
